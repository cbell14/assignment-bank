2D_Navier_Stokes_Acoustics
==========================
This is my Final Project for a Numerical Methods in Python Class at GWU. This code will start as a 2D FDM NS solver with acoustics for strucutred grid. The flow being solved will be a cavity flow. Going forward I hope to expand this code to include a staggered grid and 3 dimensions.

This may eventually evolve into another FVM solver down the line. Hopefully modeling turbulent flows using dynamic and smagorinsky models for LES simulations based on the initial DNS solver I am creating.

I am also interested in possibly doing a nozzle flow with periodic BC's for compressible flow.
